# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis of a Startup

## 📌 Project Overview
Startups often face significant supply chain challenges due to limited resources, demand uncertainty, and evolving operational processes.  
This project focuses on performing a **data-driven supply chain analysis** for a startup to identify inefficiencies and propose optimization strategies across inventory, logistics, and fulfillment operations.

The analysis demonstrates how **analytics and KPIs** can support better decision-making in early-stage supply chains.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
The startup supply chain faced issues such as:
- Inventory imbalances (stockouts and excess inventory)  
- Delays in order fulfillment  
- Inefficient carrier and logistics utilization  
- Lack of KPI-based monitoring  

**Objective:**  
Analyze historical supply chain data to uncover bottlenecks and recommend operational improvements.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Perform quantitative analysis of supply chain operations  
- Evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs)  
- Identify gaps in inventory planning and fulfillment  
- Optimize demand forecasting and safety stock levels  
- Improve delivery performance and order fulfillment  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset represents operational supply chain data for a startup.

**Key metrics analyzed:**
- Inventory levels and turnover  
- Lead time and order cycle time  
- Order fulfillment rate  
- Stockout frequency  
- Carrier performance  

> Note: The dataset is representative and structured to simulate real startup supply chain operations.
