# 📦 Supply Chain Data Analysis for a Startup

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on **Supply Chain Management** for a startup.  
The goal is to uncover inefficiencies, optimize operations, and provide actionable insights using Python-based data analytics and visualization.  

## 📊 Overview

Efficient supply chain management is critical for startups to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain competitiveness.  
In this project, we analyze supply chain data to answer key business questions such as:

- How balanced is demand vs supply?  
- Which products and suppliers perform the best?  
- Where are the cost leakages in logistics and procurement?  
- How can we optimize inventory to reduce stockouts?

  
## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this notebook includes:  

- **Orders Data** → Order IDs, product IDs, customer IDs, dates  
- **Inventory Data** → Stock levels, shortages, SKU's
- **Supplier Data** → Lead times, delivery delays, Mode of Transportation  


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python (3.8+)  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data preprocessing & analysis  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` (optional) → Predictive modeling / clustering  


## 📈 Project Workflow
